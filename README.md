## History
At the beginning of our project, the group used the whiteboard to write out tables that might be incorporated in our database. We drew connections and decided if they were a one to many relationship or a many to many relationship. For example, one of our tables was called volunteer and another was called projects. Since a volunteer can have many projects and a project can have many volunteers, we decided they had a many to many relationship. When two tables have a many to many relationship, then they need a middle table to connect the two. So then we created another table for this purpose called projects. This table then links the two tables together.

After the group had decided what tables we needed, we went ahead and created them in our database. We then hardcoded fake information just so we had some content.

Then we used one of our member's pre-existing templates that was already set up with imports. We worked together to create routes and set up html templates.
